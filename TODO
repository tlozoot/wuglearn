SOONER:

	Fix features for Éš!!

	The learner!
		- Parsing a text file
		etc...

	Documentation
		- How does it work in Python?

	Stats
		- Compare against humans
		- Compare against MinGen

LATER:

	Better alignment
		- Use a library like nw_help
		- Custom alignment?
		- Use segment similarity?

	Better segment similarity
		- Weight features
	
	Smart syllabification and segmentation
	
	Stats
		- For generating losers, weighting constraints


WAY LATER:

	Support for irregular plurals
	
	Constraint ranking algorithms
	
	Discover how words change--stemming+ with OT
		UR of affix...?
		Targeted constraints?
		
	Learning Markedness constraints
