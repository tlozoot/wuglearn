SOONER:

	The learner!
		- Parsing a text file
		- Writing some nice constraints
		- Eval
		etc...

	Documentation
		- How does it work in Python?


LATER:

	Better alignment
		- Use a library like nw_help
		- Custom alignment?
		- Use segment similarity?

	Better segment similarity
		- Weight features
	
	Syllabification
	
	Segmentation
	
	Stats
		- For analyzing data
		- For generating losers, weighting constraints


WAY LATER:

	Support for irregular plurals
	
	Constraint ranking algorithms
	
	Discover how words change--stemming+ with OT
		UR of affix...?
		Targeted constraints?
		
	Learning Markedness constraints
